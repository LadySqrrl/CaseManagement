# CaseManagement

This program is intended to help manage special education case files, evaluations, and reevaluations for school psychologists. Particularly this is useful for school psychologists working in Iowa who are able to get the IEP_activemgsservice report from the IMS admin in your AEA.

The first step in this project is setting up a MariaDB server on a RaspberryPi4. My database desing process can be observed in the Database Design Planning NOtes Folder. Now that it's designed, I'll work on getting the data from my spreadsheet into the databse.
