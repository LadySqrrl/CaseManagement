# CaseManagement

This program is intended to help manage special education case files, evaluations, and reevaluations for school psychologists. Particularly this is useful for school psychologists working in Iowa who are able to get the IEP_acivemgsservice report from the IMS admin in your AEA.

The first step in this project is setting up a MariaDB server on a RaspberryPi4. Now that I've got that done, I'll be working on designing and creating my database system using MariaDB.
